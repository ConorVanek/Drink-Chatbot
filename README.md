# Drink-Chatbot
A simple html/javascript chat bot window stylized from a CSS template I found online.

# How to use:
To view the chat window, simply create a root directory for the files and start up an http server, then go to the localhost page in a web browser.

#Disclaimer
I mostly uploaded this here just to keep track of it. Please note that the app calls a Stored procedure which is not included here. The stored procedure accepts the user's message as input, and returns information about the closest matching product.

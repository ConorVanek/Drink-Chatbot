# Drink-Chatbot
A simple html/javascript chat bot window stylized from a CSS template I found online.

The actual conversation algorithm is very basic - I designed it with retail websites in mind (particularly wine & spirits retail) so the chat bot simply looks for keywords such as "rum" or "whiskey" and picks a pre-made response that matches the keywords. Could definitely be expanded on to feel more lifelike.

# How to use:
To view the chat window, simply create a root directory for the files and start up an http server, then go to the localhost page in a web browser.
